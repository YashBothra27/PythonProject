# PythonProject
This is my basic python project.
Performed a video game analysis using Python, utilizing Pandas for data processing and Matplotlib for visualizing genre trends, global sales, and platform distribution.
In this project, I have used python libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib to analyse and visualize video game data sourced from kaggle.
This github repository includes data sourced from kaggle in csv file and the code in python in jupyter notebook.
